# Hire_Harsh - Your Resume, Now Conversational

Ever wished recruiters could just *ask* your resume questions instead of skimming through bullet points? That's exactly what Hire_Harsh does.

## What it does
Hire_Harsh lets you stand out by turning your resume into a conversation. Instead of hoping recruiters notice the right details, you give them a tool to dig deeper when something catches their interest.

---

## Getting Started

**What you need:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key (local Ollama support coming soon)

### 1. Get the Code
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Hire_Harsh
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Add Your Secrets
Edit the `.env` file:
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# Optional extras (leave empty if you don't need them)
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your_langsmith_key"     # For advanced analytics
LANGSMITH_TRACING=false

GUARDRAILS_TOKEN="your_guardrails_token"   # Extra safety (slower build)
```

**Pro tip**: The app works fine without the optional stuff. Only add them if you actually need the features.

### 3. Make It Yours
- Swap out `data/CV_Demo.pdf` with your actual resume
- Edit `data/about_me.md` with extra info not in your CV (or delete it)
- Edit `config/base.yml` if you want to change file paths or naming
- replace `/static/default-avatar.png` with your profile picture

### 4. Start the App
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Alternatively, without Docker:
```bash
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# optionally, install guardrails - you can skip these steps!
guardrails configure # interactive! You will need a token!
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/toxic_language
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/reading_time
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/profanity_free
# run the app
uvicorn main:app
```
### 5. Try It Out
Head to `http://localhost:8000` and start chatting with your resume!

## Deploy to the Cloud

The Docker container runs anywhere. Deploy it to your favorite cloud platform - AWS, Azure, GCP, whatever works for you.

**Coming soon**: Step-by-step Azure deployment guide (because that's what I use).

---

## Access Control


**Option 1: Keep it public**
```bash
INVITE_CODES={}
```
Perfect for personal websites or internal demos.

**Option 2: Lock it down**
```bash
INVITE_CODES={
  "RECRUITER1": {"company": "TechCorp", "recruiter": "Jane Smith", "active": true},
  "DEMO2024": {"company": "Demo Access", "recruiter": "Public Demo", "active": true}
}
```
Give specific people access with custom invite codes.

## How It Works

**The Stack:**
- FastAPI backend for the API
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
  - ChromaDB as Database
  - OpenAI API (or Ollama locally) as LLM
- LangChain connecting the dots
- Guardrails to keep things professional and save

**The Flow:**
1. Your resume gets chopped up and embedded into a vector database
2. When someone asks a question, we find the most relevant parts
3. The LLM writes a natural response using that context (and chat history)
4. Safety filters make sure everything stays professional

Simple, but it works really well.

## Want to Contribute?

Got ideas? Found bugs? Want to add features?

Just open an issue or send a PR. I'm always looking to make this better.

**Before you code:** Run `pre-commit install` so the CI doesn't yell at you.
