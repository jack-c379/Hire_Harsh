STAR 1 – AI Concierge for Hospitality

Situation
Hotels were overloaded with repetitive guest queries (check-in, amenities, F&B, local info) and manual check-ins. They wanted better efficiency without sacrificing guest experience, and ideally a way to lift F&B revenue from new guests.

Task
Design and launch an AI concierge app that could:

Automate a large majority of guest queries with high accuracy.

Shorten check-in times.

Increase F&B revenue, especially from first-time users.

Actions

Mapped top query categories and designed structured conversation flows for each (check-in, room issues, amenities, F&B orders, recommendations).

Worked with engineers to wire an LLM-based concierge into hotel systems: bookings, room assignments, menu data, opening hours.

Set up telemetry to track:

Automation rate (queries resolved without human fallback).

Average check-in duration.

F&B orders originating from concierge interactions.

Iterated on prompts, fallback logic, and escalation rules based on logs and error cases.

Results

90% of guest queries automated with accurate responses. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

30% faster check-ins after rollout. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

18% higher F&B revenue from first-time users exposed to the concierge. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

Impact
You turned a high-touch operational function into an AI product that improved experience, efficiency, and revenue simultaneously.

STAR 2 – GEO-first Blog App (Zero-Touch AI Content Engine)

Situation
Content-heavy organisations needed to produce large volumes of blog content, often geo- or segment-specific, but couldn’t keep scaling editorial teams.

Task
Co-create a GEO-first blog app that could:

Ideate, draft, and publish blog posts without a human in the loop.

Be discoverable across search and AI surfaces.

Actions

Designed a pipeline where a chain of AI agents:

Discover topics/keywords by geography or theme.

Generate outlines and full drafts.

Auto-apply metadata (title, tags, links) and publish.

Put in place guardrails: tone guidelines, length constraints, structure templates and checks before publishing.

Wired it into the publishing stack so content could go from idea → published automatically.

Results

10,000+ hours saved in content production and editing work. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

Content from this system earned 100+ AI Search mentions, signalling good visibility in AI-powered search experiences. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

Impact
You built a zero-touch AI content engine that removed human bottlenecks from blog production while still surfacing in AI and search ecosystems.

STAR 3 – Micro AI Apps & Early Enterprise GTM

Situation
Founders and small teams often need sharp, point-solution AI tools (resume QA, SEO reviews, etc.), but don’t have time to build or maintain them. On your side, you needed to prove these AI products could generate real ARR, not just demo-ware.

Task

Ship micro AI apps for high-value, narrow problems.

Orchestrate an early enterprise GTM to convert usage into revenue.

Actions

Built micro solutions like:

“Chat with my resume” – converting CVs into interactive Q&A agents. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

AI SEO audit – scanning websites and summarising issues and opportunities. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

Ran focused GTM:

Targeted founders and product/growth leaders.

Pitched outcomes (time saved, quality of insights) rather than features.

Tracked activation, retention, and usage patterns to refine pricing and packaging.

Results

Secured $1M ARR in 12 months across products. 

Harsh Jaiswal Resume 9Dec

Drove 3× active user growth across the product portfolio.
